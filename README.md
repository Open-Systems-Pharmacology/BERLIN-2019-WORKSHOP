# BERLIN-2019-WORKSHOP
SGS Exprimo and the FU Berlin will run a two-days hands-on PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshop on introducing PBPK for human dose projection and drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction on 21st-22nd Feb 2019 at the Institute of Pharmacy, FU-Berlin, Germany.

This workshop will cover the concepts and application of combining PK-Sim and MoBi to build your very own PBPK models for the
prediction of first dose in human or effects of drug-drug interactions by integrating physiological and mechanistic knowledge with
preclinical information to translate to the clinic.

## KEY LEARNING
During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:
* Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
* Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi for PBPK-PD disease modelling
* Simulate and analyse DDI reactions with inhibitors and inducers of drug metabolism

This workshop will be held jointly by consultants and scientists from SGS-Exprimo and the FU Berlin who have extensive experience in Pharmacometrics and PBPK modelling in drug development.

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users
